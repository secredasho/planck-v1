# Planck Games
# v1.0.0 - v1.0.7
Made webpage, added proxy.html + games.html, styled everything.
# v1.0.8
Added Input, restyled buttons.
# v1.1.0
# plans
by v1.2 (I think) the main goal is to remove all the html files and put them into a folder, somehow.
v1.2 will get a complete makeover of the UI, maybe even a redesign of the entire project
currently deployable on zeabur, vercel, idk.
